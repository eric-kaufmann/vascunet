# VascuNet

## Overview
The VascuNet project aims to develop a neural network model capable of analyzing the mesh representation of a vessel and generating blood flow-specific properties for that vessel. These properties may include but are not limited to flow rate, velocity profile, pressure distribution, and shear stress.

## Project Status
At its current stage, the project is in its infancy. Research and development are ongoing to establish the foundational framework for the VascuNet. This involves data collection, preprocessing, model architecture design, and initial testing.

## Key Objectives
Data Collection: Gather diverse and representative datasets of vessel meshes and corresponding blood flow properties.
Preprocessing: Develop methods to preprocess vessel meshes and extract relevant features for model input.
Model Architecture: Design a neural network architecture suitable for learning the complex relationships between vessel geometry and blood flow dynamics.
Training and Evaluation: Train the model using collected data and evaluate its performance in predicting blood flow properties accurately.
Iterative Improvement: Continuously refine the model through iterative experimentation and optimization to enhance its accuracy and generalization capability.

## Getting Started
Since the project is still in its early stages, there are no specific instructions for usage or installation.
